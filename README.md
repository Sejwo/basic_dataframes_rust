Hello traveller, 

Again, this is a bare-bones, work-i-progress implementation. I created this with a sole purpose of having a nice, neat and controllable environment for creating decision trees.
With time I intend to build up upon it, once the shape and direction of the project is clearer. I want this to also come together with the ACO project. So I could have the ultimate boss of decision trees with ants as supporting mechanism.
